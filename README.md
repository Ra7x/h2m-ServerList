This is a list of servers for h2m-mod, an IP checker and an auto-downloader.

If you want to add this server list to your game, you have to options:
 - Download "favourites.json" and copy it into the "players2" folder.
 - Copy the update_serverList.bat in your game folder and execute it,
 if the file isn't installed in your correct directory it will dowload it directly from our GitHub repository and launch your game 

If you want to add an specific IP address, whether from a private server or a server from https://master.iw4.zip/servers#serverModalCenter, copy the IP address and paste it into the favourites.json file in the appropriate format (Remember that the file
should be located at the "players2 folder").

If you want to check if an IP address you wish to add is already in the list you downloaded from our repo, use the "index.html" file, which contains a script to determine if that IP address is in the favourites.json list
